# r_t_board
realtime-comment-board

this is the sample board system for practice nodejs and express  
same like another common board system, but this can see another person is typing comment & post comment real time.  
and another person can see you typing comment & post comment too. like chatting system.  
don't need F5 or refresh button for post.
I developed this comment system using socket.io

### this is monolithic service

### you have to create database collection. I will offer board create system in this project.
